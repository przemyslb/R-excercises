How many chicks weight more than this average? 
How many chicks are on each diet

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
head(ChickWeight)
df<-ChickWeight
```
What is the average weight of a chicken after 21 days?

```{r cars}
df3<-df %>%
  filter(Time >= 21) %>%
  select(weight, Time, Chick, Diet)
#weight of the chichen (to see if there is any difference)
mean(df$weight)
#mean weight of the chicken after 21 days
mean(df3$weight)
takemean<-mean(df3$weight)
#i take it so i can use it next
```

How many chicks weight more than this average? 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
df4<-df %>%
  filter(weight >= takemean) %>%
  select(weight, Time, Chick, Diet)
nrow(df4)

```

How many chicks are on each diet
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
df %>%
    group_by(Diet) %>%
    summarise(count=n())
totalrows<-nrow(df)
totalrows
x<-220 + 120 + 120 + 118
x==totalrows
```
